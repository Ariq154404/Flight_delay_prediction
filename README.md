# Flight Delay Prediction

## Overview
This project is centered around the analysis and prediction of flight delays, using the comprehensive dataset provided by the US Department of Transportation, as featured on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays/data). The primary goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately determine the likelihood of a flight delay based on various factors.

## Dataset
The dataset encompasses detailed flight information, including airlines, flight numbers, departure and arrival times, and delay durations. It offers a rich source for exploring factors that contribute to flight delays.

## Features
The project involves several key stages:
- **Data Loading**: Importing the dataset for analysis.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyzing the data to uncover patterns and insights.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features that can aid in the predictive model.
- **Model Training**: Building a machine learning model to predict flight delays.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the model.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required packages.

## Usage
Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to load the dataset, perform exploratory data analysis, preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
